      <p>Welcome to Part II of my series on ML-Agents in Unity. In the last part I got a
simple model working that allowed two armies of soldiers to fight each other,
however, they weren't actually trying to <em>win</em>. In this part, I will be working
towards that goal.</p>
<h1>Adjusting Rewards</h1>
<p>In part I, I had been rewarding my agents for both being victorious and each
time they dealt damage to the enemy. Eventually I removed the victory reward to
simplify things and push the agents to get into combat. Now I tried adding
victory rewards again to see what happens. I tried several variations on reward
values, each with a different hit reward (That is, the reward for each
individual attack that hits an enemy).  Below you can see the resulting scores,
they are:</p>
<ul>
<li>No victory reward and 1.0 hit reward</li>
<li>1.0 victory reward and 0.3 hit reward</li>
<li>1.0 victory reward and 0.1 hit reward</li>
<li>1.0 victory reward and no hit reward</li>
</ul>
<p>
<figure><img src="https://zchfvy.com/images/mlagents_2/rewards_1.png"><figcaption>Rewards, from top to bottom these are in the same order as the above list</figcaption>
</figure>
</p>
<p>As you can see, the runs with a lower hit reward result in a lower peak total
reward.  This is as-expected, since each hit is worth less the total reward is
less. What's more interesting is that as I reduce the hit reward the
convergence to the final reward takes longer, with the no-hit-reward version
failing to increase at all. Furthermore, the agent behaviour is exactly the same
as in article 1: they fight, but they don't try to win.</p>
<p>There are two possible reasons for this that crossed my mind at this point,
either</p>
<ul>
<li>The way I am training the agents is unable to learn a wining strategy</li>
</ul>
<p>or</p>
<ul>
<li>There is no winning strategy</li>
</ul>
<p>In order to narrow down the problem, I made a modification here to ensure that a
winning strategy exists. I made the following change: when a soldier is near
another soldier they both benefit from mutual-defence, getting 50% resistance to
damage for <em>each</em> nearby soldier!  So if a soldier is near one ally it will only
take 50% damage, and if near two allies it will take only 25% damage and so on.
With this change there is now, obviously, a winning strategy: simply stick
together in a blob.</p>
<p>So I did further training, to see if it learned now:</p>
<p>It didn't, what's wrong?</p>
<h1>Using Self-Play</h1>
<p>The issue is that when using reinforcement learning, training works by tring to
maximize the average reward. Since all the soldiers are training the same model
together it means that if one side gets an advantage it increases that side's
score, but correspondingly decreases the other side's. In gambling terms
it would be like putting an equal bet on each side: it's never gonna lose,
but also never gonna win.</p>
<p>I need a way to make each side train independently, to do that each side needs
to count its rewards separately. But I still want the agent to be able to play
against itself so it gets better over time. So what I need to do is to train one
team (red team) and then after each round copy its data to the other team (blue
team).  The second (blue) team never actually trains it just receives copies
from the red team, this way the blue team's reward doesn't affect the final
outcome.</p>
<p>Even if I do this, there is still a problem of overfitting: the agent may become
so focused on beating it's own strategies that it becomes unable to defeat more
varied strategies. To ensure this doesn't happen rather than just copying the
strategy that the agent played last round, I save the agent's data at various
points throughout training and then chose a random one as the opponent to train
against.</p>
<p>Now, that's all well and good, but it sounds like an awful lot of work,
fortunately the same day I got to this point in the process Unity released a
wonderful <a href="https://blogs.unity3d.com/2020/02/28/training-intelligent-adversaries-using-self-play-with-ml-agents/?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=ml_global_generalpromo_2020-02-28_mlagents-self-play&amp;utm_content=blog">blog article</a>
on self-play in ML-Agents, the detailed documentation is
<a href="https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/422bbcd3d4e82dae6acc3b12e189f257d160eaa7/docs/Training-Self-Play.md">here</a>.
With that in mind, I got started.</p>
<p>First I needed to make a lot of changes involving upgrading ML-Agents to the
latest version, this involved:</p>
<ul>
<li>Upgrade ml-agents to 0.14.1</li>
<li>Upgrade baracuda to 0.5.0</li>
<li>Delete my Academy class (They are now singletons, and I wasn't really using
  it)</li>
<li>Add a <code>DecisionRequestor</code> component to my agent to allow it to self-update
  (It doesn't do that by default anymore) </li>
<li>Take note of the fact that a 'step' in the tensorboard output is now just a
  single step for a single agent in the scene, before a step included one step
  for <em>each</em> agent in the scene, so I must increase my max-steps accordingly,
  since I have 10 agents in the scene I am going from 500,000 steps to
  5,000,000 steps.</li>
</ul>
<p>I also got rid of the team-shuffling from the first article, it again, wasn't
really used.</p>
<p>Now, that simply upgrades to the new ML-agents, to make use of the self-play
feature I must:</p>
<ul>
<li>Set the agent's <code>Team ID</code> variable correctly</li>
<li>Add a 'loss' condition with a -1 reward (Just best practice, not strictly
  required)</li>
<li>Add a self-play block to my hyperparameter configuration</li>
</ul>
<p>The self-play block is as-follows:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="nt">self_play</span><span class="p">:</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="nt">window</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">10</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="nt">play_against_current_self_ratio</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">0.5</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="nt">save_steps</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">50000</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="nt">swap_steps</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">50000</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>With all that done it's time to go ahead and train this.</p>
<h1>Self-play results</h1>
<p>Unfortunately, training didn't initially go as planned, the first run gave me
this same senselessly aggressive behaviour as before:</p>
<p>
<figure><video controls src="https://zchfvy.com/images/mlagents_2/soldiers_II_3.mp4"></video><figcaption>Same agressive behaviour as at the end of the last article I wrote</figcaption>
</figure>
</p>
<p>After running this I went through a series of practical issues (bugs) including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Forgetting to actually save the file with the self-play block above</li>
<li>Not setting the rewards correctly</li>
<li>Not actually calling the agent's "Done" function on winning agents (And I was
  doing this in part I too, blind luck that it worked at all!)</li>
<li>Not having an acceptable maximum length of each round (The early rounds
  sometimes took a very long time, which was wasteful)</li>
<li>Incorrectly handling updates on 'dead' agents</li>
</ul>
<p>Each time I went through one of these issues (Of which there are more than the
above) it involved a many-hour long training run. Slowly, I managed to get
behaviour that converged towards a type of "Spiralling tactic". I didn't notice
it so much in the earlier runs, but after an 5.5 hour run it became clear that
this behaviour was emerging. This was <em>really</em> interesting to me because it's
clear the AI was learning <em>something</em>, but also something I didn't expect and
cannot explain. Unexpected emergent behaviour is one of the coolest things to
see in AI so I was really excited.</p>
<p>Since I now knew that the AI was actually learning I went back to my simulation
parameters and increased the radius in which having an ally reduces damage
taken. Since it was getting late I let this train overnight, and when I woke up
it had trained for eighteen hours and resulted in this:</p>
<p>
<figure><video controls src="https://zchfvy.com/images/mlagents_2/14.1_selfplay_forreal_9.mp4"></video><figcaption>There's some "spiralling" tactic going on here, but not the "clumping" I was looking for.</figcaption>
</figure>
</p>
<p>Beautiful! But about the time it took to train... 18 hours might be acceptable
for overnight training of a fancy production model, it might even be okay for a
in-development model that is well-understood, but for just messing around trying
to figure things out like what I'm doing here it's far too long. Fortunately,
there was a simple way to accelerate this.</p>
<p>By switching to running standalone builds rather than running inside the Unity
editor, I was able to run at 3x the time acceleration and also run 8 instances
of the training at once. Theoretically that should be 3x8=24x faster! In
practice though it was only 6x faster (At some point I ought to go back and
optimize this) though this is still good enough for me! This cut my previous
18hr run (Which effectively limited me to one run/day) to a mere 3 hours (Which
can be done 3-4 times a day). Also, since I can now practicly run this in
daylight hours rather than overnight I can now early abort if I notice it's
failing early on, allowing me even more time to iterate.</p>
<p>
<figure><img src="https://zchfvy.com/images/mlagents_2/bintrain.png"><figcaption>You can see the much faster training of the standalone build, horizontal axis is hours.</figcaption>
</figure>
</p>
<p>After things were running nice and faster, I did a few slight tweaks. I
didn't like how the soldier's were acting overly defensive, even when they had a
big advantage (3 on 1 or so). I speculated this was because they only had
information on where enemies are, and not a clear picture of how many enemies
there are. To resolve this I added the following observations:</p>
<ul>
<li>My agent's own health</li>
<li>How many allies are alive</li>
<li>The average health of my allies</li>
<li>How many enemies are alive</li>
<li>The average health of my enemies.</li>
</ul>
<p>With this in place, another run of 3 hours got me to this result:</p>
<p>
<figure><video controls src="https://zchfvy.com/images/mlagents_2/bintrain_4_worldinfo.mp4"></video><figcaption>Soldiers now group together for mutual defence!</figcaption>
</figure>
</p>
<p>As you can see, they have the behaviour I was looking for, and when one side
gains an obvious advantage they go in for the kill</p>
<p>With that at this point I'm kinda happy with it for the time being. And since I
have iterated over the codebase of this quite a few times in this process it has
become kinda messy. I'm gonna put this aside for now and try to work on another
problem for my next article!</p>
<p>Thanks for reading!</p>
