      <p>Welcome to part 2 of my War Thunder bot series, If you missed it, the intro
to the project is in <a href="/wtbot_intro.html">Part 1</a>.</p>
<p>In this part I will go over the techniques used to extract information about
the planes current state from the HUD instruments in the "glass cockpit" view.
I will be using  the <a href="http://opencv.org/">OpenCV</a> libraries to do this,
specifically <a href="https://opencv-python-tutroals.readthedocs.org/en/latest/">OpenCV-Python</a>.</p>
<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>First, let's take a look at the War Thunder "glass cockpit" as it appears
in-game.</p>
<p>
<figure><img src="https://zchfvy.com/images/wtbot_imagerec/screenshot.png"><figcaption>The War Thunder glass cockpit view</figcaption>
</figure>
</p>
<p>There are three basic sets of instruments here that I want to draw data
from, they are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attitude_indicator">attitude indicator</a>
  in the middle of the screen.</li>
<li>The compass at the top-center of the screen.</li>
<li>The instruments panel in the top-left of the screen.</li>
</ul>
<p>I want to gather information from all of these. Specifically I need the
aircrafts orientation, speed, and altitude. Things like oil temperature aren't
useful to the bot's intended purpose (though I will be grabbing them anyways
as it isn't much more work).</p>
<h1>Preprocessing</h1>
<p>Before I can start extracting data the image needs to be processed to make
it easier for the computer to read. Right now the HUD elements are white on
light blue, hard to see even for a human. Also, the image will look different
when the bot is facing a darker or lighter part of the sky, I want to eliminate
that variation. Finally, an image reduced to just the two possibilities of
black and white is much simpler to analyze.</p>
<p>The first step in this process is doing away with color (which provides no
information in this context) and turning the image to grayscale, there is
nothing fancy about how this works and everyone has seen it many times before.</p>
<p>
<figure><img src="https://zchfvy.com/images/wtbot_imagerec/gray.png"><figcaption>Converted to grayscale</figcaption>
</figure>
</p>
<h2>CLAHE</h2>
<p>Next I am going to do a contrast adjustment. To do this I will use the
<b>C</b>ontrast <b>L</b>imited <b>A</b>daptive <b>H</b>istogram
<b>E</b>qualization algorithm, or 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_histogram_equalization">CLAHE</a>.
The Wikipedia article is a little verbose, but if you ever used the
"Auto levels" function in Photoshop it's kind of like that, except it's applied
individually to different areas of the image instead of once over the whole
image. If you still can't understand that, or have just never used Photoshop
before, then perhaps this image of the result will help:</p>
<p>
<figure><img src="https://zchfvy.com/images/wtbot_imagerec/clahe.png"><figcaption>CLAHE applied</figcaption>
</figure>
</p>
<p>As you can see, this has greatly increased contrast. All the HUD elements
are now much clearer, and even the "E" (indicating east) near the top of the
image stands out quite well, it was previously nearly invisible against the
sun.</p>
<p>Before the next step, I quadruple the size of the image, scaling it to 2x
across both dimensions. My trial-and-error testing found that this made the
next step work much better.</p>
<h2>Thresholding</h2>
<p>The next step itself, involves applying an adaptive Gaussian thresholding
algorithm (no fancy acronym this time!). This is a little more complex than
the CLAHE algorithm, but even if the textual description is confusing the
picture should provide a good image of what's going on (pun intended).</p>
<p>The basic idea of thresholding is that you take all pixels in an image brighter
than a certain value and make them white, and all pixels darker than that value
are made black. Theoretically this should give you a nice cut-out of all
the elements you are looking for, because they are much brighter or darker
than the background. In practice, however, this only works for the most basic
of cases, and even then is often a poor fit.</p>
<p>This is where the "Adaptive Gaussian" part comes into play. Like with the
CLAHE algorithm I am going to apply the threshold individually to different
areas of the image, selecting an appropriate threshold based on the brightness
of the surrounding pixels, thats the "adaptive" part. The Gaussian part means
that the surrounding pixels contribution to the threshold is weighted on a bell
curve, with the nearer pixels having more weight than ones further away.</p>
<p>If my description was inadiqute, the
<a href="http://docs.opencv.org/master/d7/d4d/tutorial_py_thresholding.html#gsc.tab=0">OpenCV Page</a>
on this provides some good examples (look at the soduku puzzle).</p>
<p>The result (with the 2x scaling) is this ugly monstrosity:</p>
<p>
<figure><img src="https://zchfvy.com/images/wtbot_imagerec/threshold.png"><figcaption>Thresholded image</figcaption>
</figure>
</p>
<p>While it may not be nice to look at, it does provide a very consistent and high
contrast image, all the things I am looking for stand out and are very
distinct.  And, it's pure black and white, no greys, all ready for analysis.</p>
<h1>Attitude and Heading</h1>
<p>With the image now pre-processed, it's time to take some data from it. I
should mention here however, that the above steps do not take place over
the whole screen as in the screenshots, instead this is only run over the
small space surrounding the elements the bot is interested in. This speeds up
the analysis significantly.</p>
<p>In-game the attitude indicator and compass actually slide around as you do sharp
maneuvers, but this bot should not be doing any fancy-stunt flying so I
have provided just a small margin beyond the spaces I am looking in to account
for small movements.</p>
<h2>Template Matching</h2>
<p>The basic idea behind reading attitude and heading relies on looking for the
numbers and/or letters that indicate heading and locating them on the screen.
To do this I use the <strong>template matching</strong> functionality of OpenCV. This
allows me to give OpenCV an image of what I'm looking for and have it slide
the image across the screen, analyzing how much it matches up with what's under
it and giving me the results.</p>
<p>In order to do this, I had to collect images to compare to, and since I am
looking at a processed image they would also need to be processed the same way.
Since I already had the code to do this, it wasn't difficult to make it just
save a small segment of the result as an image (much harder was flying my
plane at precisely all the requisite angles and headings to produce source
data).</p>
<p>The result was a directory full of images like this:</p>
<p>
<figure><img src="https://zchfvy.com/images/wtbot_imagerec/templates.png"><figcaption>My folder of template images</figcaption>
</figure>
</p>
<p>Once I had these it was just a case of doing a bit of tuning to the minimum
confidence cutoff, and a bit of code to eliminate cases where the same spot
was detected twice.</p>
<p>Now that I had the co-ordinates of these things, It was time to do something
with them.</p>
<h2>Getting Heading</h2>
<p>I actually wrote the code for the heading detection last, though it is far
simpler than attitude detection. Here is how it works:</p>
<p>There's going to be a bit of math here, if that scares you, don't worry! I'm
not going to go too deep into details, the specifics are uninteresting anyways.
Most of what goes on in this section involves comparing the positions of the
detected templates to known locations on the screen.</p>
<p>The algorithm tries to find just one of the templates given to it, and compare
it's position to the position at the center of the screen. At this point it
knows a heading, and it knows how far away from it it is in terms of screen
pixels. With the default settings I determined the ratio between screen pixels
and degrees to be about 1/18. By multiplying the pixel offset by this ratio, 
you get a degrees offset, which is then added to the heading the template
represents.</p>
<p>Perhaps a diagram will show it better.
(Note, the screenshot shows a full color image, but the actual processing is
happening on a pre-processed image)</p>
<p>
<figure><img src="https://zchfvy.com/images/wtbot_imagerec/heading.png"><figcaption>Heading detection</figcaption>
</figure>
</p>
<p>The readout in the background is printing out the timestamp of the capture and
the heading captured, separated by a comma. The green line in the diagram
represents the offset from the template that was found. The result of 262.69 
degrees is found by taking the length of the line, multiplying it by 1/18,
and then adding it to 260 (The 26 indicates 260 degrees).</p>
<h2>Getting Attitude</h2>
<p>If you can understand that, attitude detection is not too much harder. For this
I detect <strong>two</strong> templates and then draw a line between them. Then, from the
midpoint of this line I draw upwards or downwards until I am lined up with
the center of the screen (Or, more technically, I project the vector between
the midpoint of the line and the center of the screen onto the vector normal
to the line). Whatever description you followed, I am left with a line that
I can use to do the exact same calculation as was done to detect heading.</p>
<p>
<figure><img src="https://zchfvy.com/images/wtbot_imagerec/attitude.png"><figcaption>Attitude detection</figcaption>
</figure>
</p>
<p>In this diagram the light blue line is the one being measured. The dark blue
line is the one drawn between the two detected templates. The output is in the
same format, with timestamp and value. In this case taking the length of the
light blue line, multiplying by 1/18 and subtracting from 20 degrees gives the
result of 16.32 degrees.</p>
<h1>The Instrument Panel</h1>
<p>That's all and good for the analog instruments on the HUD, but those
techniques won't work for the "digital" instruments in the top left, I would
need a template for every possible readout!</p>
<p>With that not possible, I turned to <b>O</b>ptical <b>C</b>haracter
<b>R</b>ecognition, or <strong>OCR</strong>. OCR takes images of text, and turns them into
plain text. The Tesseract OCR library/utility is suitable for my needs and has
a python binding (kind of).</p>
<h2>Pre-Processing... Again!</h2>
<p>But, before I can use OCR on the image there's a bit more pre-processing I
need to do to ensure best results. The output from thresholding gives us ugly
outlined text, which produces some terrible results when naively run through
tesseract.</p>
<p>The processing solution, is fortunately simple, I just do a fill on the image.
To hearken back to the Photoshop analogy, it's like the paint bucket tool. The fill
is the same color as the outlines so they become hidden and all that's left is
the insides of the text. I've also inverted the image to be black text on 
white, instead of white text on black.</p>
<h2>Tesseract</h2>
<p>With the processing done I ran Tesseract against my image and observed the
output. But even after the post processing, there were some issues...</p>
<p>
<figure><img src="https://zchfvy.com/images/wtbot_imagerec/garbled.png"><figcaption>This won't work</figcaption>
</figure>
</p>
<p>This is hardly usable. I found it entertaining though that my altitude is
503 watts, and my indicated airspeed has units that are the union of knots
and hours, I guess that's still a speed since a union is analogous to
a multiplication? (Or maybe disregard that last sentence, it was a bad
attempt at a math joke).</p>
<p>The solution to this, was as unintuitive as it is boring. I just cropped the
image area to cut off the units, and voilà:</p>
<p>
<figure><img src="https://zchfvy.com/images/wtbot_imagerec/instruments.png"><figcaption>This will</figcaption>
</figure>
</p>
<p>There are still a few issues, notably the "S" in "IAS" has been cut off
completely by the second round of pr-processing. Also some recognitions
are slightly off: "GNN" "HATER" and "BNSTRUCTOR", but this data is still
very much workable.</p>
<h1>Next Time</h1>
<p>The data recovered from this isn't perfect. The instrument panel has obvious
issues with not reading correctly sometimes. And the attitude and heading
detection have some error in them, and sometimes they don't read at all
(that is, they output "None").</p>
<p>In the next section I will discuss filtering this data to clean up these
issues and provide consistent and clean data to the bot.</p>
